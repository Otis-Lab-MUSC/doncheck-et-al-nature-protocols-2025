# Drug Self-Administration in Head-fixed Mice

*This repository aggregates all code, hardware designs, and supporting resources for the Nature Protocols paper: "Drug self-administration in head-fixed mice" by Elizabeth M. Doncheck et al. (2025). For the full protocol, see the [published article](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-025-XXXXX).*

## Overview

This meta-repository serves as a centralized hub for reproducible implementation of the head-restrained intravenous and oral self-administration protocol in mice. It links to modular components of the REACHER open-source behavioral software stack, custom hardware designs (including 3D-printable parts via Tinkercad), and optimized surgical protocols for catheter implantation.

For detailed step-by-step instructions, refer to the paper's protocol sections on equipment construction, software setup, surgery, and behavioral training.

## Resources
